yarl - Yet Another Roguelike
============================

This is an incomplete and fairly scrappy attempt at writing a roguelike version of an indirect-control
god-game; pretty much the only thing you can do is designate blocks for imps to dig out; the routefinding
isn't particularly smart either and quite often you'll end up with imps running miles inbetween jobs because
of the way the job scheduling works. Ah well.

It's written in Python (2.6), and uses PyGame.
